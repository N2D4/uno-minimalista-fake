# uno-minimalista-fake

An attempt at a fake Uno Minimalista concept art, as designed by Warleson Oliveira, in CSS. I'm not affiliated with Uno in any way.

[Oliveira's original](https://www.behance.net/gallery/90273937/UNO-Versao-Minimalista)

Anyone claiming to sell these is probably scamming you. They're not being sold, not currently at least. (I don't know what Mattel & Oliveira are up to...)

Sorry for the ugly website, my stuff usually looks better ;)
