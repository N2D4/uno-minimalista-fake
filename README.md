# uno-minimalista-fake

EDIT: Mattel and Oliveira [announced plans](https://gizmodo.com/mattel-turned-this-graphic-designers-minimalist-uno-dec-1841832127) to sell Uno Minimalista, making this project kind of useless. Only buy from official sources because there's still a lot of scams out there

An attempt at a fake Uno Minimalista concept art, as designed by Warleson Oliveira, in CSS. I'm not affiliated with Mattel in any way.

Sorry for the ugly website, my stuff usually looks better ;)

[@realChesta](https://github.com/realChesta) did the exact same thing and neither of us knew about the other's until we were both done, so take a look at [his version](https://github.com/realChesta/uno-card-test) :D
